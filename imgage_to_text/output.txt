A. Financial assets (continued)
Financial asset at amortized cost
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost, if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows (HTC): and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding It results in cash flows that are only payments of the principal amount and commission on the principal amount
outstanding. This evaluation is referred to as the "pay test only from principal and commission", and this evaluation is performed at the level of
the financial instrument.
Accounts receivable and contract assets, which are held to collect contractual cash flows that are expected to result in cash flows that are solely
payments of principal, or cash flows that are solely payments of principal and commission on the principal amount that do not carry a significant
financing portion, are measured at transaction cost.
Financial asset at FVOCI
Equity instruments
On initial recognition, for an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair
value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.
Debt instruments
A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (HTCS);
and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding.
Financial asset at FVTPL
All financial assets not classified as held at amortized cost or FVOCI are classified as FVTPL.
In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at
amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes its business model for managing
financial assets.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Shareholders of Elm Company
(Saudi Joint Stock Company)

Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Elm Company (the "Company") and its subsidiaries
(together "the Group"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December
2024, and the consolidated statements of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
consolidated statement of changes in equity, and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended
and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2024 and its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with IFRS Accounting
Standards that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements issued
by the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants ("SOCPA").

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing ("ISAs") that are endorsed in
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are
independent of the Group in accordance with the requirements of International Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants (including International Independence Standards), endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the
"Code"), that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code's requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit
of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

In addition, the considerations of the agent and principal according to the International Financial Reporting Standard no.15 "Revenues from Contracts with Customers" require the management to analyze the terms and conditions of the contracts with the customers to assess whether the Group is principal or agent, which affects the Group's presentation of revenues on a gross or net basis. | • We involved our IT specialists in testing the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of controls related to revenue recognition for a sample of digital business. • We tested a sample of reports extracted from the IT systems used for digital business revenues and match them with the amount recorded in the general ledger. • We traced a sample of digital business revenue with collected amounts in the Group's bank statements. • We tested a sample of transactions recorded before and after the year end to ensure that revenues were recorded in the appropriate period. • We audit those judgments taken by management to assess whether the Group is a principal or agent for a sample of the contracts. • We evaluated the adequacy and appropriateness of disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements |

Independent auditor's report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements of Elm Company for
the year ended 31 December 2024 (continued)
Key Audit Matters (continued)
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Expected credit losses provision for trade receivables and contract assets
As at 31 December 2024, the Group's accounts Our procedures included the following:
receivable and contract assets balance amounted to SR
4.25 billion, against which an impairment allowance
of SR 715 million is maintained.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether the
accounts receivable and contract assets are impaired.
Management has applied an expected credit loss
("ECL") model to determine the appropriate
allowance for impairment loss. Further, the Group
performs an assessment based on a defined policy for
certain categories of accounts receivables and contract
assets.
The determination of allowance for expected credit
losses is based on certain assumptions that relate
mainly to risk of default and expected loss rates. The
Group applies judgement in making these assumptions
and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation,
based on the Group's past history, market conditions,
as well as forward looking estimates.
We considered this as a key audit matter due to the
level of judgment applied and estimates made in the
application of the ECL.
•
We obtained an understanding of the process
used by management in determining the
allowance for expected credit losses for the
accounts receivable and contract assets.
•
•
•
•
•
Involved internal specialists to review the
expected credit loss (ECL) model and tested
key assumptions in relation to forward-looking
information, review the modelling inputs,
techniques used and assessed overall adequacy
of the model in light of the profile of trade
receivable and contract asset;
We tested the completeness and mathematical
accuracy of the ECL model.
We assessed the assumptions used by
management in connection to the determination
of allowance for expected credit losses for
certain categories of accounts receivable and
contract assets.
We tested, on a sample basis, the calculation
performed by management on allowance for
expected credit losses for these categories of
customers and contract assets.
We evaluated the adequacy and appropriateness
of disclosures included in the consolidated
financial statements.

Independent auditor's report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements of Elm Company for
the year ended 31 December 2024 (continued)
Other information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's
report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, when made available to us, if we conclude that there is a material
misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial
Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other
standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA and Regulations for Companies and the Company's By-laws,
and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with Governance, i.e., the Company's Board of Directors, are responsible for overseeing the
Group's financial reporting process.
Auditor's responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control.

Independent auditor's report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements of Elm Company for
the year ended 31 December 2024 (continued)
Auditor's responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
•	Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
•	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.
•	Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a
going concern.
•	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the
financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and
performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that
we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate
threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, and are therefore
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should
not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

(A SAUDI JOINT STOCK COMPANY)
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024
All amounts in Saudi Riyals
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
2.1 Statement of compliance and basis of preperation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are endorsed
in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements endorsed by the Saudi Organization for Chartered and professional Accountants
("SOCPA").
Certain prior year figures have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation (Note 39).
2.2 Basis of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Elm Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred as the
Group").
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group. The Group controls an enterprise when it has controlling interest over the investee Company and
when the Company is exposed to variable returns or has rights to these returns as a result of its participation with the entity and it also has the ability
to influence these returns through the power it exerts on the enterprise.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or excluded during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income from the actual acquisition date or until the actual date of disposal, as appropriate.
All inter-Company balances, assets, liabilities and equities, revenue, expenses, and cash flows related to group transactions between the Company
and its subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation of the financial statements.
The non-controlling interests in the net assets of the subsidiary are determined separately from the equity of the Company.
The accounting policies applied by the subsidiaries are in accordance with the group's accounting policies. Adjustments are made to the financial
statements of the subsidiaries to comply with the financial statements of The Group, as required.
In case of loss of control over a subsidiary, it ceases to recognize the related assets (including goodwill, if applicable), liabilities, non-controlling interests
and other components of equity, and the resulting gain or loss is then recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
2.3 Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for:
•	Employee end-of-service benefits which have been measured at the present value of future obligations using projected unit credit method
which is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income,
•	Other financial assets which are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or profit or loss; and
•	Long-term interest (advances payment for future equity shares) in associate companies, where they are measured at fair value through profit
or loss.
•	Share-based payment measured at fair value for the share price at the grant date.
2.4 Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Saudi Riyals which represents the functional currency for the group.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
2.5 Use of assumptions and estimates and important accounting judgments
2.5.1 Important accounting judgments in applying accounting policies
The following are important judgments, regardless of those that include estimates made by the Group's management during the process of applying
the Group's accounting policies which have a significant and major impact on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements:
Determining Significant influence
Management considers that the group has significant influence over an entity when the group is exposed to risks or has rights to a significant part of
the variable returns arising from its involvement with the investee and when it has the ability to make changes to the investee Company to affect
or participate in affecting that returns through its ability to participate in directing the related activities of the investee companies.
The determination of significant influence depends on the way decisions are made regarding the relevant activities and the Group's rights in the
investee companies.
In general, there is an assumption that owning a significant portion of the voting rights (typically above 20% of the voting rights) leads to a significant
influence.
Management use the equity method for investees where it has a significant influence, when ownership is in ordinary shares and other instruments
that are substantially similar to the ordinary shares of the investee (""in-substance ordinary shares"). Management assesses that for an instrument
to qualify as an in-substance ordinary share for this purpose, an instrument would need to carry rights that are substantially the same as the investee's
ordinary shares and provide returns associated with those ordinary shares. When investing in Start-up's management assess whether the investment
is substantially similar to the investment in the ordinary shares of the investee, and take into consideration all the characteristics below:
1- Subordination rights
2-Risks and rewards of ownership
3- Obligation to transfer value
Management has assessed that there are substantive subordination rights of the preferred shares the group owns as compared to the ordinary shares,
causing the instruments not to be substantially similar. Accordingly, the management measures these investment at fair value, and present it as part

Determination of control
Subsidiaries are all investee companies that the Group controls. Management considers that the Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed
to, or has rights, to most variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect
those returns through its ability to direct relevant activities. Relationship with the investee companies.
The determination of the group's control depends on the way decisions are made regarding the related activities and The Group's rights in the investee
companies.
In general, there is an assumption that having a majority of voting rights leads to control. In support of this presumption, when The Group has equal
or less than a majority of the voting rights of the investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances when assessing whether it
exercises control over the investee, including contractual and other arrangements that have an effect on activities that affect the returns of the
investee companies.

2.5 Use of assumptions and estimates and important accounting judgments (continued)
2.5.1 Important accounting judgments in applying accounting policies (continued)
Principal versus agent
The Group has made an assessment of its arrangements to determine whether it is acting as principal and then presents revenue at gross or agent
and then presents revenue on a net basis. In this evaluation, the group took into account obtaining or not obtaining control over the stipulated goods
or services before they are transferred to the customer. As well as other indicators like if the party is primarily responsible for fulfillment and
appreciation when setting the price, and in cases where the group conducts Agency activities related In accordance with a contract whereby the end
customer receives project management and coordination support. The group only proves net commission income where you arrange for a third party
to transfer goods or services under that arrangement and thus act as an agent.
Determine the lease term for contracts that include renewal and termination options
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if
it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination clauses. The Group applies judgment in evaluating whether it is
reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. It considers all relevant factors that create an economic
incentive for it to exercise either the renal or termination. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant
event or change in the circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate
the contract.
2.5.2 Using assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed in the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities
as at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates
are based on management's knowledge of current events and procedures, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates due to
circumstances out of the groups control. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and adjustments to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the adjustment affects only that period or in the period of the review
and future periods if the adjustment affects current and future periods.
The following are important assumptions that relates to future periods and other major sources of uncertainty in the estimates in the financial
reporting period that may have significant risks that result in substantial adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for the upcoming
financial year:
Estimated useful lives and residual values of property and equipment and intangible assets
The useful lives and residual values of property, equipment and intangible assets are calculated for the purposes of calculating depreciation and
amortization, respectively. These estimates are made based on the expected usage of individual assets. The residual value is determined based on
experience and observable data when available.

2.5 Use of assumptions and estimates and important accounting judgments (continued)
2.5.2 Using assumptions and estimates (continued)
The assumptions used to estimate the impairment of non-current assets
Determining the impairment of non-current assets requires making a value-in-use for non-current assets or the cash-generating unit where the non-
current assets belong. The value used in the calculation requires the management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the
non-current assets or the cash generating unit and an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the present value. An impairment loss can be
significant when the actual future cash flows are less than expected.
The assumptions used to determine the actuarial value of end of service benefits provision
Defined benefit obligations are discounted at a rate set by reference to relevant market yields at the end of the reporting period. Significant judgment
is required when setting the criteria for which yield curve is derived. this includes government premium risk and identifying changes to be eliminated.
Zakat provision
Zakat provision is estimated at the end of each reporting period in accordance with the regulations of the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA),
and on an annual basis zakat returns are submitted to the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority. The adjustments resulting from the final zakat
assessment are recorded during the reporting period in which this assessment is approved by the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority.
Calculation of expected credit losses provision
The estimate of the expected credit loss allowance is calculated in accordance with the accounting policy detailed in (Note 3)(A-4).
The Group uses a dedicated matrix for the purpose of calculating expected credit losses for accounts receivable, contract assets and employee
receivables. This matrix is initially based on historical default rates. The Group calibrates the matrix to adjust the historical experience of credit losses
for forward-looking information, at each reporting date the Group updates the historical default rates and this is reflected in the forward-looking
estimates. Management also estimates the credit loss for specific cases separately.
The Group also utilizes a dedicated matrix for the purpose of calculating the present value of money for government receivables, through which it
estimates the expected collection date by applying certain assumptions and inputs such as historical collection experience per client.
Expected credit losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The difference between the amounts collected in future periods
and the amounts expected will be recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
The assumptions used to determine the actuarial value of end of service benefits provision
The Group has made various estimates to determine the actuarial value of the employee end of service benefits provision. These estimates are
disclosed in Note 29.

2.5.2 Using assumptions and estimates (continued)
The assumptions used to measure revenue
The Group estimates revenue based on the expected average collection of control and inspection projects, based on historical data associated with
these projects.
Incremental borrowing rate for leases
The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease agreement, therefore, it uses its Incremental Borrowing Rate ("IBR") to
measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds
necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group
'would have to pay', which requires estimation when no observable rates are available, such as for subsidiaries that do not enter into financing
transactions or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease. The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs,
such as market interest rates when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following is a statement of the significant accounting policies used by the group in preparing these consolidated financial statements:
3.1 Classification of assets and liabilities as "current" and "non-current"
The group presents the assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position as current / non-current. The assets are classified
current when:
•	It is expected to be realized or intended to be sold or exhausted during the normal operations cycle.
•	If it is acquired mainly for trading purposes;
•	It is expected to be realized within 12 months after the financial period; or
•	When it is cash and cash equivalents unless there are restrictions on their replacement or their use to pay off any liabilities for a period not less
than 12 months after the financial period.
All other assets are classified as "non-current".
All liabilities are classified current when:
•	It is expected to be paid during the normal operations cycle;
•	If acquired mainly for trading purpose;
•	It is due for payment within 12 months after the financial period; or
•	There is no unconditional right to postpone the payment of liabilities for a period not less than 12 months after the financial period.
All other liabilties are classified as "non-current".

3.2 Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes
place either:
•	In the principal market for the asset or liability :or
•	In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability,
assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits from the asset's
highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would utilize the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses appropriate valuation methods in accordance with the circumstances, and sufficient data are available for it to measure the fair value
and increase the use of observable inputs and reduce the use of unobservable inputs.
All other assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value
hierarchy mentioned below and based on the lowest level inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement as whole.
•	Level 1- quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (i.e. without modifying or renewing prices);
•	Level 2 - fair value measurements that consider significant lower level inputs that are observable directly or indirectly: and
•	Level 3 - fair value measurements that don't consider significant lower level inputs that are unobservable.
With respect to the assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a frequent basis, the Group
determines whether the transfer has occurred between the hierarchical levels to measure the fair value by recalibrating the classification (based on
significant lower level inputs to measure the fair value as a whole) at the end of each financial period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosure, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks
of assets and liabilities and a hierarchy of levels of fair value measurement mentioned above (Note 38).
3.3 Business Combination process for common-controlled entities
Business combination transactions that involve acquiring businesses under common control, where the consideration is not subject to market forces,
are accounted for by recognizing the assets and liabilities of the acquired company at their book value, and no goodwill resulting from the acquisition
is recorded. Any increase or decrease between the transferred consideration and the book value of the acquired company's net assets is directly
recognized in equity.
The consolidated financial statements after the acquisition are presented from the announced acquisition date, without consolidating or restating the
comparative year figures. Any costs incurred during the acquisition process are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

3.4 Investments in associates and a joint venture
3.4.1 Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but does not have control or joint control over it. Significant influence is the
Group ability to participate in the financial and operating policies decisions of the investee but has no control or joint control over those policies.
The considerations made in determining significant influence are holding- directly or indirectly voting rights in the investee, representation on the
board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee, participation in policy-making, including participation in decisions about dividends or
other distributions; material transactions between the Group and its investee; interchange of managerial personnel; or provision of essential technical
information.
3.4.2 Joint arrangements
Joint control is that which arises from a contractual agreement to share control of an arrangement and only occurs when decisions about the relevant
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations considered in determining whether joint control exists are
like those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures or joint operations. This depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each
investor, regardless of the legal form of the joint arrangement. The Group has an investment in a joint venture (Note 16).
3.4.2.1 Joint venture
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the
joint venture. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognized at cost in the consolidated
statement of financial position.
3.4.3 Equity method
The investment in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statement of the Group using the equity method of accounting. The
investment in associates in the consolidated statement of financial position is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the
Group's share of the profit and loss and other comprehensive income of the associate adjusted for any impairment in the value of net investment. In
addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when
applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. When the Group's share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group's interest in that
associate or joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate or joint
venture), the Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses.
Additional losses are recognized and recorded as liabilities only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made
payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealized gain or losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
Unrealized gains or losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate company are excluded to the extent of the Group's
ownership share in the associate company.
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognizes any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference
between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from
disposal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
When the Group discontinues accounting for an investment under the equity method due to a loss of control or significant influence, any retained
interest in the entity is re-measured at fair value, and the change in carrying amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. This
fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate or a financial
asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had
directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified
directly to the consolidated statement of profit or loss or the consolidated statement of financial position.

3.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue from contracts with customers
The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using five steps method as mentioned in IFRS 15:
Step (1): Identify the contract (s) with the customer. A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable
rights and obligations and clarifies the foundations and criteria that must be fulfilled for each contract.
Step (2): Identify the performance obligations in the contract. A performance obligation is an undertaking stipulated in the contract with the customer
to transfer a good or service to the customer.
Step (3): Determine the transaction price: The transaction price represents the amount of compensation that the group expects to have the right in
exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer except the amounts that are collected on behalf of third parties.
Step (4): Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations stipulated in the contract. For contracts that involve more than one
performance obligation, the Group will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation, in an amount that the Group expects to have
the right to fulfill each performance obligation.
Step (5): Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Group fulfills a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over a period of time if one of the following controls is met:
A) The performance of the Group does not originally create an asset with an alternative use to the Group, and the group has the right to enforce
payment in exchange for the performance completed to date.
B) Group performance creates or improves a customer-controlled asset at the same time that the asset is constructed or improved.
C) The customer receives the benefits provided by the performance of the facility and consumes it at the same time once the group has performed.
With regard to performance obligations, if any of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at a point of time.
In the event that the Group fulfills the performance obligation through providing the promised services, this will lead to the creation of an asset based
on a contract in exchange for compensation earned from the performance. In the event that the compensation received by the customer exceeds
the amount of proven revenue, a contract obligation may arise. The Group takes in consideration the transition of the asset (or service) that fulfills
the performance obligation, if applicable.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, after taking into consideration the terms of the contractual
payment, and after excluding taxes and fees. The Group reviews revenue arrangements in accordance with specific criteria to ascertain whether it
is acting as principal or agent.
When the Group is not highly certain of the possibility of collecting from certain customers, the revenue is recognized upon collection.

3.5 Revenue recognition (continued)
Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits of the Group will flow, and that revenue and costs, if applicable,
can be measured reliably.

The following is an explanation of the revenue recognition method for each segment:
1- Digital Business: Digital business revenue consists of two types: products and projects, revenue from products are recognized as follows for
subscriptions over a period of time, as for transactions, they are recognized at a point in time. Project revenue over time and at a point in time
based on the nature of the performance obligation specified in the contract.
2- Business Process Outsourcing: Revenue from the business process outsourcing segment consists of projects. Revenue can be recognized over time
and at a point in time based on the nature of the performance obligation specified in the contract.
3- Professional Services: Professional services segment revenue consists of projects. Revenue can be recognized over time and at a point in time
based on the nature of the performance obligation specified in the contract.
3.6 Foreign currencies
Balances and foreign transactions
Originally, transactions in foreign currencies are transferred by the Group's entities at the exchange rates prevailing in the functional currency of the
date on which the transaction occur.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates prevailing in the functional currency at the date
of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Differences arising from settlement or transfer of monetary items are recognized in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost, recorded in a foreign currency, are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at
the date of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items recorded in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value at the exchange rates prevailing
at the date when the fair value is determined are transferred. Profits or losses resulting from the conversion of non-monetary items that are measured
at fair value are treated in accordance with the recognition of gains or losses resulting from the change in the fair value of the item (i.e. exchange
differences are recognized on items whose profit or loss is measured at fair value in other comprehensive income or consolidated statement of profit
or loss, respectively).

3.7 Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. This cost includes cost of replacing part of
the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs related to long-term construction projects, in case the evidentiary standards are met. If the
replacement of important parts of plant and equipment is required on stages, the group consumes these parts independently over their useful lives.
Conversely, when a major examination is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the equipment as a replacement, if the
recognition criteria are met. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as incurred. The
present value of the expected cost of removing an asset (if any) after its use is included in the cost of the underlying asset in the event that the
evidentiary criteria related to the recognition of the allowance are fulfilled.
Any item of property and equipment and any significant part that was initially recognized is discontinued upon exclusion or when there are no future
benefits expected from use or disposal. Any gains or losses arising from discontinuation of any asset (calculated as the difference between the net
proceeds from disposals and the carrying amount of the asset) are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which the
asset is discontinued.
The residual value, useful lives, and methods of depreciation of property and equipment are reviewed at the end of each financial period and
adjustments are made in the future, if appropriate.
Under construction projects appear at the cost incurred until the asset is prepared for the purpose for which it was created. This cost is then capitalized
to the related assets. Cost includes the cost of contractors, materials, services, and capital advances.
The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment on a straight line basis. The following are the expected useful life of the group's property and
equipment:
• Leasehold improvements: 5 years or contract term, whichever is less
• Information system devices: 3-5 years
• Buildings: 25 – 33 years
• Vehicles: 4 – 5 years
• Furniture and fixtures: 4 – 7 years

3.8 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired independently are initially measured at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of entities represents
the fair value at the date of acquisition. After initial recognition, intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated
impairment losses. Internally developed intangible assets are capitalized.
Intangible assets with a specified life are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and reviewed to ensure that there is an impairment in its value
when there is an evidence that indicates that a decrease has occurred. The period and method for amortization of intangible assets with a finite
useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each financial reporting period. Changes in the accounting of expected useful life or the method of
amortizing future economic benefits embodied in the asset - through adjusting the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and it is considered
as changes in accounting estimates. Amortization expense for intangible assets with specific lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit
or loss as an expense and in line with the function of the intangible assets.
Intangible assets that do not have a specific life are not amortized, but are tested annually to ensure that there is no impairment in their value either
alone or at the cash-generating unit level. The indefinite life asset is reviewed annually to ensure that the assessment made for the unspecified useful
life is still supported, otherwise the change from "specified life" to "unspecified life" will be made on a future basis.
Research and development costs are recognized as incurred. Development costs for a specific project are recognized as an intangible asset when the
group can demonstrate the following:
•	The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.
•	The intention to complete the asset and the ability and intention to use or sell the asset.
•	The method of using the asset will generate future economic benefits.
•	The availability of resources to complete the asset.
•	The ability to measure the costs during development reliably.
After the initial recognition of development costs as an asset, the asset is recorded at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated
impairment losses, if any. Amortization of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for its intended use. It is amortized
over its expected future useful life. The amortization is recorded under the expense category in accordance with the function of the intangible assets.
During the development period, the asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Profits or losses resulting from discontinuation of the recognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss upon discontinuation of the asset.
Computer programs, platforms, Licenses and patents are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization, and accumulated impairment losses.
Historical cost includes the expenses directly related to purchasing items.
Projects under development related to intangible assets are presented within the capital work-in-progress item in the financial position until the asset
is ready for its intended use. It is then transferred to the relevant intangible assets category. The cost primarily includes software license fees and
developer salaries.
Amortization is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, and may be
charged against the related assets if it represents a portion of their costs
Computer software, electronic systems, and licenses are amortized over a period of 5 years unless they have an indefinite useful life. Patents are
amortized based on the term of the issued certificate.

3.9 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group, at the date of preparing the consolidated financial statements, makes an assessment to ensure that there is no evidence of any impairment
in the value of an asset. In case that such evidence exists or when an annual test is required to confirm the existence of an impairment in the value,
the Group estimates the recoverable amount for that asset. The recoverable amount represents the higher value of the fair value of the asset or cash
generating unit, less costs of disposal and the present value, and is determined for each asset, except in cases where the asset does not generate cash
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group assets. In cases where the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating
unit exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable amount.
When estimating the present value, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
market assessments for the time value of money and the risks inherent in the asset. When determining the fair value less cost of sales, it is taken into
consideration the latest market transactions that are available. Where no such factors can be identified, appropriate valuation methods are used.
The Group calculates present value based on the information used in calculating the detailed budgets and forecasts, which are prepared independently
for each cash generating unit in the group to which the asset is allocated. The information used to calculate budgets and expectations usually covers
a five-year period. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to the expected future cash flows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses from continuing operations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
For assets, except goodwill, an evaluation is performed at the date of preparing all consolidated financial statements, to ensure that there is any
indication that there were no previously reported impairment losses or decreases. If such evidence exists, the Group estimates the recoverable
amount of the asset or cash generating unit. The previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions
used to determine the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal of the entry is limited so that the book value
of the asset does not exceed the recoverable value of it nor the book value that was supposed to be determined after deduction of depreciation if
the impairment loss was not proven in previous years. This reversal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or losses.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested to ensure that there is no annual decrease in their value, either individually or at the cash-
generating unit level, as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
3.10 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are shown in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise cash at banks, cash in hand, and murabaha deposits
with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and short-term deposits as stated
above after deducting bank overdrafts (if any) since it's considered an integral part of the Group's cash management.
3.11 Murabaha deposits
Long-term murabaha deposits include long-term deposits with banks with an original maturity of more than three months. Bank deposits are
considered as a cash management tool for the group. Returns from bank deposits are accounted for in the consolidated statement of profit or loss
when due.

3.12 Dividend distribution
The Group recognizes distributions to shareholders as a liability when the distribution is approved. The corresponding amount is recognized directly in

3.13 Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has current or expected legal obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that the outflow of
resources with economic benefits will be necessary to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be performed.
When the Group expects that some or all of the provisions will be recovered, for example under an insurance contract, the recoveries are recognized
as a separate asset but only when these recoveries are almost confirmed. The expense related to the provision is displayed in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss after discounting any recoverable amounts. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted
using the current pre-tax rate, which reflects, when appropriate the risks related to the obligation. When using a discount, the increase in the provision
due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.
3.14 Segmental reporting
The Group's operating segments are identified based on internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Group's chief operating decision maker
(chief operating decision maker) in order to allocate resources between the segments and to assess their performance.

The group provides end of service benefits to the employees if eligible as a defined benefit program.

assets, (if any), less the present value of the defined benefit obligations expected at the preparation date of the consolidated financial statements.
The Group is required to make assumptions about variables such as discount rates, salary increase rate, longevity, employee turnover and future
healthcare costs, where applicable. Changes in the underlying assumptions can have a significant impact on the expected benefit obligations and the
costs of defined employee benefits. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
The defined benefit liabilities are periodically re-measured by independent actuaries using the expected credit unit method. The present value of the
defined benefit liabilities is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using commission rates for high-quality corporate bonds that
are recorded in the currency in which the benefits are to be paid, and which have terms close to the terms of the related obligations. Commission
cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit liabilities and the fair value of the program assets. This cost
is included in employee benefits expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

3.15 Employee end of service benefits (continued)
The costs of the defined benefit liabilities for the initial periods are calculated on an annual basis using the rate of actuarially defined pension cost at
the end of prior year, after adjusting for significant market fluctuations and any significant one-time events, such as program adjustments or
manpower cuts and reimbursement. In the absence of such significant market fluctuations and one-time events, actuarial liabilities are carried forward
based on assumptions at the beginning of the year. If there are material changes to the assumptions or arrangements during the initial period, a re-
measurement of these liabilities is taken into consideration.
Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, are reflected immediately in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit liabilities resulting from settlements or downsizing the program are recognized directly in
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as a past service cost.
A liability assessment under these programs is performed by an independent actuary based on the expected credit unit method. The costs related to
these programs consist mainly of the present value of related benefits, on an equal basis, in each year of service and commissions on this obligation in
relation to employee services in prior years.
The costs of current and prior services related to post-employment benefits are recognized directly in the consolidated statement of other
comprehensive income while the increase in the commitment to the discount rates recorded as a financing costs. Any changes in net liabilities as a
result of actuarial valuations and changes in assumptions are re-measured to other comprehensive income.
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with regard to the employee end of service benefits provision, the actuarial valuation process takes into consideration
the Saudi labor law and the group policy.
3.16 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual instrument.
The following are the significant accounting policies followed by the group for the classification, recognition, and measurement of financial instruments:
A. Financial assets
A.1 Classification and initial Recognition
The classification and initial recognition of financial assets depends on the Group's business model for managing its financial assets and the contractual
terms of the cash flows. The Group classifies and recognizes its financial assets as follows:
• Financial asset at amortized cost:
•
Financial asset at Fair value through Profit or loss ("FVTPL"); and
• Financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVOCI").
Below is a detailed statement of the classification and initial proof of each of the above-mentioned items;

3.16 Financial instruments (continued)
A. Financial assets (continued)
Financial asset at amortized cost
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost, if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows (HTC): and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding It results in cash flows that are only payments of the principal amount and commission on the principal amount
outstanding. This evaluation is referred to as the "pay test only from principal and commission", and this evaluation is performed at the level of
the financial instrument.
Accounts receivable and contract assets, which are held to collect contractual cash flows that are expected to result in cash flows that are solely
payments of principal, or cash flows that are solely payments of principal and commission on the principal amount that do not carry a significant
financing portion, are measured at transaction cost.
Financial asset at FVOCI
Equity instruments
On initial recognition, for an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair
value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.
Debt instruments
A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (HTCS);
and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding.
Financial asset at FVTPL
All financial assets not classified as held at amortized cost or FVOCI are classified as FVTPL.
In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at
amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes its business model for managing
financial assets.

A.2 Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into three categories:
Financial asset at amortized cost
-Debt Instruments
Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the Effective Interest Rate ("EIR") method and are subject to impairment. Gain
and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.
As at the date of preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Group does not have any debt instrument assets.
-Accounts receivable and contract assets
Accounts receivable and contract assets, which are held to collect contractual cash flows that are expected to result in cash flows that are solely
payments of principal, or cash flows that are solely payments of principal and commission on the principal amount that do not carry a significant
financing portion, are measured at transaction cost. Subsequent measurement and impairment are described in the note on impairment (Note 3.16,
Paragraph A.4).
Financial asset at FVTPL
The financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL") are measured at each reporting date at fair value without the deduction
of transaction costs that the Group may incur on sale or disposal of the financial asset in the future.
Financial asset at FVOCI
Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income at the end of each reporting period and the transaction costs that
the Group incurs when the assets are disposed of in the future are not discounted.
A.3 De-recognition
A financial asset or a part of a financial asset is de-recognized when:
• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
• The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without
material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement, and either:
a) The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or
b) The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the asset.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount assigned to the part of the
asset for which recognition was expected) and the sum of (i) the consideration received and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss recognized in other
comprehensive income It is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

A.4 Impairment
Management assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECL associated with its account receivables, contract assets and employee receivables.
Management applies the simplified approach in calculating ECL's. Therefore, management does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognized
a loss allowance base on lifetime ECL's at each reporting date. Management has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. Also, management evaluate on on-going
basis the credit risk where it takes additional ECL for specific cases where applicable.
A.5 Business model assessment
The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model under which an asset is held, at a portfolio level because this best reflects the
way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:
•	the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management's strategy
focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to
the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets;
•	how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;
•	the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are
managed:
•	how managers of the business are compensated-e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual
cash flows collected: and
•	the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However,
information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of Financial assets that are held for trading and whose performance is
evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held to collect
contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.
The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. If cash
flows after initial recognition are realized in a way that is different from the Group's original expectations, the Group does not change the classification
of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased
financial assets going forward.

A.6 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI" criteria)
For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is the consideration for the time
value of money, the credit and other basic lending risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period and other basic
lending costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), along with profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the
instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual
cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment the Group considers:
•	contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows:
•	leverage features;
•	prepayment and extension terms;
•	terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements); and
•	features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).
B. Financial liabilities
B.1 Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are classified under either of the below two classes:
•	Financial liabilities at gain value through profit or loss ("FVTPL"); and
•	Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method ("EIR") method.
The category of financial liability at FVTPL has two sub-categories:
•	Designated: A financial liability that is designated by the entity as a liability at FVTPL upon initial recognition; and
•	Held for trading: A financial liability classified as held for trading, such as an obligation for securities borrowed in a short sale, which have to be
returned in the future. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging
instruments in hedge relationships. Separated embedded derivatives are classified as held for trading.
All financial liabilities are recognized initially when the Group becomes party to contractual provisions and obligations under the financial instrument.
The liabilities are recorded at fair value.
As of the date of this financial statement the group doesn't have any financial liabilities at FVTPL.
B.2 Subsequent measurement
Financial liabilities at FVTPL continue to be recorded at fair value with changes being recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
For other financial liabilities, including loans and borrowings, after initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR
method. Gain or loss are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the liabilities are de-recognized as well as through the EIR
amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR
method. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
For accounts payables and contract liabilities. They are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.

Independent auditor's report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements of Elm Company for
the year ended 31 December 2024 (continued)
Key Audit Matters (continued)
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Expected credit losses provision for trade receivables and contract assets
As at 31 December 2024, the Group's accounts Our procedures included the following:
receivable and contract assets balance amounted to SR
4.25 billion, against which an impairment allowance
of SR 715 million is maintained.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether the
accounts receivable and contract assets are impaired.
Management has applied an expected credit loss
("ECL") model to determine the appropriate
allowance for impairment loss. Further, the Group
performs an assessment based on a defined policy for
certain categories of accounts receivables and contract
assets.
The determination of allowance for expected credit
losses is based on certain assumptions that relate
mainly to risk of default and expected loss rates. The
Group applies judgement in making these assumptions
and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation,
based on the Group's past history, market conditions,
as well as forward looking estimates.
We considered this as a key audit matter due to the
level of judgment applied and estimates made in the
application of the ECL.
•
We obtained an understanding of the process
used by management in determining the
allowance for expected credit losses for the
accounts receivable and contract assets.
•
•
•
•
•
Involved internal specialists to review the
expected credit loss (ECL) model and tested
key assumptions in relation to forward-looking
information, review the modelling inputs,
techniques used and assessed overall adequacy
of the model in light of the profile of trade
receivable and contract asset;
We tested the completeness and mathematical
accuracy of the ECL model.
We assessed the assumptions used by
management in connection to the determination
of allowance for expected credit losses for
certain categories of accounts receivable and
contract assets.
We tested, on a sample basis, the calculation
performed by management on allowance for
expected credit losses for these categories of
customers and contract assets.
We evaluated the adequacy and appropriateness
of disclosures included in the consolidated
financial statements.

the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the annual report, when made available to us, if we conclude that there is a material
misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial
Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other
standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA and Regulations for Companies and the Company's By-laws,
and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or
has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with Governance, i.e., the Company's Board of Directors, are responsible for overseeing the
Group's financial reporting process.

Auditor's responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control.

Independent auditor's report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements of Elm Company for
the year ended 31 December 2024 (continued)

Auditor's responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
•	Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
•	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.
•	Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a
going concern.
•	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the
financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and
performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that
we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate
threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, and are therefore
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should
not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
2.1 Statement of compliance and basis of preperation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are endorsed
in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements endorsed by the Saudi Organization for Chartered and professional Accountants
("SOCPA").
Certain prior year figures have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation (Note 39).
2.2 Basis of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Elm Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred as the
Group").
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group. The Group controls an enterprise when it has controlling interest over the investee Company and
when the Company is exposed to variable returns or has rights to these returns as a result of its participation with the entity and it also has the ability
to influence these returns through the power it exerts on the enterprise.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or excluded during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income from the actual acquisition date or until the actual date of disposal, as appropriate.
All inter-Company balances, assets, liabilities and equities, revenue, expenses, and cash flows related to group transactions between the Company
and its subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation of the financial statements.
The non-controlling interests in the net assets of the subsidiary are determined separately from the equity of the Company.
The accounting policies applied by the subsidiaries are in accordance with the group's accounting policies. Adjustments are made to the financial
statements of the subsidiaries to comply with the financial statements of The Group, as required.
In case of loss of control over a subsidiary, it ceases to recognize the related assets (including goodwill, if applicable), liabilities, non-controlling interests
and other components of equity, and the resulting gain or loss is then recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
2.3 Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for:
• Employee end-of-service benefits which have been measured at the present value of future obligations using projected unit credit method
 which is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income,
• Other financial assets which are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or profit or loss; and
• Long-term interest (advances payment for future equity shares) in associate companies, where they are measured at fair value through profit
 or loss.
• Share-based payment measured at fair value for the share price at the grant date.
2.4 Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Saudi Riyals which represents the functional currency for the group.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
2.5 Use of assumptions and estimates and important accounting judgments
2.5.1 Important accounting judgments in applying accounting policies
The following are important judgments, regardless of those that include estimates made by the Group's management during the process of applying
the Group's accounting policies which have a significant and major impact on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements:

Determining Significant influence
Management considers that the group has significant influence over an entity when the group is exposed to risks or has rights to a significant part of
the variable returns arising from its involvement with the investee and when it has the ability to make changes to the investee Company to affect
or participate in affecting that returns through its ability to participate in directing the related activities of the investee companies.
The determination of significant influence depends on the way decisions are made regarding the relevant activities and the Group's rights in the
investee companies.

In general, there is an assumption that owning a significant portion of the voting rights (typically above 20% of the voting rights) leads to a significant
influence.

Management use the equity method for investees where it has a significant influence, when ownership is in ordinary shares and other instruments
that are substantially similar to the ordinary shares of the investee ("in-substance ordinary shares"). Management assesses that for an instrument
to qualify as an in-substance ordinary share for this purpose, an instrument would need to carry rights that are substantially the same as the investee's
ordinary shares and provide returns associated with those ordinary shares. When investing in Start-up's management assess whether the investment
is substantially similar to the investment in the ordinary shares of the investee, and take into consideration all the characteristics below:
1- Subordination rights
2-Risks and rewards of ownership
3- Obligation to transfer value
Management has assessed that there are substantive subordination rights of the preferred shares the group owns as compared to the ordinary shares,
causing the instruments not to be substantially similar. Accordingly, the management measures these investment at fair value, and present it as part
of other financial assets.

Determination of control
Subsidiaries are all investee companies that the Group controls. Management considers that the Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed
to, or has rights, to most variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect
those returns through its ability to direct relevant activities. Relationship with the investee companies.
The determination of the group's control depends on the way decisions are made regarding the related activities and The Group's rights in the investee
companies.

In general, there is an assumption that having a majority of voting rights leads to control. In support of this presumption, when The Group has equal
or less than a majority of the voting rights of the investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances when assessing whether it
exercises control over the investee, including contractual and other arrangements that have an effect on activities that affect the returns of the
investee companies.

2.5 Use of assumptions and estimates and important accounting judgments (continued)
2.5.1 Important accounting judgments in applying accounting policies (continued)
Principal versus agent
The Group has made an assessment of its arrangements to determine whether it is acting as principal and then presents revenue at gross or agent
and then presents revenue on a net basis. In this evaluation, the group took into account obtaining or not obtaining control over the stipulated goods
or services before they are transferred to the customer. As well as other indicators like if the party is primarily responsible for fulfillment and
appreciation when setting the price, and in cases where the group conducts Agency activities related In accordance with a contract whereby the end
customer receives project management and coordination support. The group only proves net commission income where you arrange for a third party
to transfer goods or services under that arrangement and thus act as an agent.
Determine the lease term for contracts that include renewal and termination options
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if
it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination clauses. The Group applies judgment in evaluating whether it is
reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. It considers all relevant factors that create an economic
incentive for it to exercise either the renal or termination. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant
event or change in the circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate
the contract.
2.5.2 Using assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed in the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities
as at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates
are based on management's knowledge of current events and procedures, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates due to
circumstances out of the groups control. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and adjustments to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the adjustment affects only that period or in the period of the review
and future periods if the adjustment affects current and future periods.
The following are important assumptions that relates to future periods and other major sources of uncertainty in the estimates in the financial
reporting period that may have significant risks that result in substantial adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for the upcoming
financial year:
Estimated useful lives and residual values of property and equipment and intangible assets
The useful lives and residual values of property, equipment and intangible assets are calculated for the purposes of calculating depreciation and
amortization, respectively. These estimates are made based on the expected usage of individual assets. The residual value is determined based on
experience and observable data when available.

2.5 Use of assumptions and estimates and important accounting judgments (continued)
2.5.2 Using assumptions and estimates (continued)

The assumptions used to estimate the impairment of non-current assets
Determining the impairment of non-current assets requires making a value-in-use for non-current assets or the cash-generating unit where the non-
current assets belong. The value used in the calculation requires the management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the
non-current assets or the cash generating unit and an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the present value. An impairment loss can be
significant when the actual future cash flows are less than expected.

The assumptions used to determine the actuarial value of end of service benefits provision
Defined benefit obligations are discounted at a rate set by reference to relevant market yields at the end of the reporting period. Significant judgment
is required when setting the criteria for which yield curve is derived. this includes government premium risk and identifying changes to be eliminated.

Zakat provision
Zakat provision is estimated at the end of each reporting period in accordance with the regulations of the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA),
and on an annual basis zakat returns are submitted to the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority. The adjustments resulting from the final zakat
assessment are recorded during the reporting period in which this assessment is approved by the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority.

Calculation of expected credit losses provision
The estimate of the expected credit loss allowance is calculated in accordance with the accounting policy detailed in (Note 3)(A-4).
The Group uses a dedicated matrix for the purpose of calculating expected credit losses for accounts receivable, contract assets and employee
receivables. This matrix is initially based on historical default rates. The Group calibrates the matrix to adjust the historical experience of credit losses
for forward-looking information, at each reporting date the Group updates the historical default rates and this is reflected in the forward-looking
estimates. Management also estimates the credit loss for specific cases separately.
The Group also utilizes a dedicated matrix for the purpose of calculating the present value of money for government receivables, through which it
estimates the expected collection date by applying certain assumptions and inputs such as historical collection experience per client.
Expected credit losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The difference between the amounts collected in future periods
and the amounts expected will be recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

The assumptions used to determine the actuarial value of end of service benefits provision
The Group has made various estimates to determine the actuarial value of the employee end of service benefits provision. These estimates are
disclosed in Note 29.

2.5.2 Using assumptions and estimates (continued)
The assumptions used to measure revenue
The Group estimates revenue based on the expected average collection of control and inspection projects, based on historical data associated with
these projects.
Incremental borrowing rate for leases
The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease agreement, therefore, it uses its Incremental Borrowing Rate ("IBR") to
measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds
necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group
'would have to pay', which requires estimation when no observable rates are available, such as for subsidiaries that do not enter into financing
transactions or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease. The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs,
such as market interest rates when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates.
3.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following is a statement of the significant accounting policies used by the group in preparing these consolidated financial statements:
3.1 Classification of assets and liabilities as "current" and "non-current"
The group presents the assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position as current / non-current. The assets are classified
current when:
•	It is expected to be realized or intended to be sold or exhausted during the normal operations cycle.
•	If it is acquired mainly for trading purposes;
•	It is expected to be realized within 12 months after the financial period; or
•	When it is cash and cash equivalents unless there are restrictions on their replacement or their use to pay off any liabilities for a period not less
than 12 months after the financial period.
All other assets are classified as "non-current".
All liabilities are classified current when:
•	It is expected to be paid during the normal operations cycle;
•	If acquired mainly for trading purpose;
•	It is due for payment within 12 months after the financial period; or
•	There is no unconditional right to postpone the payment of liabilities for a period not less than 12 months after the financial period.
All other liabilties are classified as "non-current".

3.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.2 Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes
place either:
•	In the principal market for the asset or liability :or
•	In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability,
assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits from the asset's
highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would utilize the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses appropriate valuation methods in accordance with the circumstances, and sufficient data are available for it to measure the fair value
and increase the use of observable inputs and reduce the use of unobservable inputs.
All other assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value
hierarchy mentioned below and based on the lowest level inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement as whole.
•	Level 1- quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (i.e. without modifying or renewing prices);
•	Level 2 - fair value measurements that consider significant lower level inputs that are observable directly or indirectly: and
•	Level 3 - fair value measurements that don't consider significant lower level inputs that are unobservable.
With respect to the assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a frequent basis, the Group
determines whether the transfer has occurred between the hierarchical levels to measure the fair value by recalibrating the classification (based on
significant lower level inputs to measure the fair value as a whole) at the end of each financial period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosure, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks
of assets and liabilities and a hierarchy of levels of fair value measurement mentioned above (Note 38).
3.3 Business Combination process for common-controlled entities
Business combination transactions that involve acquiring businesses under common control, where the consideration is not subject to market forces,
are accounted for by recognizing the assets and liabilities of the acquired company at their book value, and no goodwill resulting from the acquisition
is recorded. Any increase or decrease between the transferred consideration and the book value of the acquired company's net assets is directly
recognized in equity.
The consolidated financial statements after the acquisition are presented from the announced acquisition date, without consolidating or restating the
comparative year figures. Any costs incurred during the acquisition process are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

3.4 Investments in associates and a joint venture
3.4.1 Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but does not have control or joint control over it. Significant influence is the
Group ability to participate in the financial and operating policies decisions of the investee but has no control or joint control over those policies.

The considerations made in determining significant influence are holding- directly or indirectly - voting rights in the investee, representation on the
board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee, participation in policy-making, including participation in decisions about dividends or
other distributions; material transactions between the Group and its investee; interchange of managerial personnel; or provision of essential technical
information.

3.4.2 Joint arrangements
Joint control is that which arises from a contractual agreement to share control of an arrangement and only occurs when decisions about the relevant
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations considered in determining whether joint control exists are
like those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures or joint operations. This depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each
investor, regardless of the legal form of the joint arrangement. The Group has an investment in a joint venture (Note 16).
3.4.2.1 Joint venture
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the
joint venture Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognized at cost in the consolidated
statement of financial position.

3.4.3 Equity method
The investment in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statement of the Group using the equity method of accounting. The
investment in associates in the consolidated statement of financial position is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the
Group's share of the profit and loss and other comprehensive income of the associate adjusted for any impairment in the value of net investment. In
addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when
applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. When the Group's share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group's interest in that
associate or joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate or joint
venture), the Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses.

Additional losses are recognized and recorded as liabilities only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made
payments on behalf of the associate.

Unrealized gain or losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.

Unrealized gains or losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate company are excluded to the extent of the Group's
ownership share in the associate company.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognizes any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference
between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from
disposal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

When the Group discontinues accounting for an investment under the equity method due to a loss of control or significant influence, any retained
interest in the entity is re-measured at fair value, and the change in carrying amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. This
fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate or a financial
asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had
directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified
directly to the consolidated statement of profit or loss or the consolidated statement of financial position.

3.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue from contracts with customers
The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using five steps method as mentioned in IFRS 15:
Step (1): Identify the contract (s) with the customer. A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable
rights and obligations and clarifies the foundations and criteria that must be fulfilled for each contract.
Step (2): Identify the performance obligations in the contract. A performance obligation is an undertaking stipulated in the contract with the customer
to transfer a good or service to the customer.
Step (3): Determine the transaction price: The transaction price represents the amount of compensation that the group expects to have the right in
exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer except the amounts that are collected on behalf of third parties.
Step (4): Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations stipulated in the contract. For contracts that involve more than one
performance obligation, the Group will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation, in an amount that the Group expects to have
the right to fulfill each performance obligation.
Step (5): Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Group fulfills a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over a period of time if one of the following controls is met:
A) The performance of the Group does not originally create an asset with an alternative use to the Group, and the group has the right to enforce
payment in exchange for the performance completed to date.
B) Group performance creates or improves a customer-controlled asset at the same time that the asset is constructed or improved.
C) The customer receives the benefits provided by the performance of the facility and consumes it at the same time once the group has performed.
With regard to performance obligations, if any of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at a point of time.
In the event that the Group fulfills the performance obligation through providing the promised services, this will lead to the creation of an asset based
on a contract in exchange for compensation earned from the performance. In the event that the compensation received by the customer exceeds
the amount of proven revenue, a contract obligation may arise. The Group takes in consideration the transition of the asset (or service) that fulfills
the performance obligation, if applicable.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, after taking into consideration the terms of the contractual
payment, and after excluding taxes and fees. The Group reviews revenue arrangements in accordance with specific criteria to ascertain whether it
is acting as principal or agent.
When the Group is not highly certain of the possibility of collecting from certain customers, the revenue is recognized upon collection.

Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits of the Group will flow, and that revenue and costs, if applicable,
can be measured reliably.

The following is an explanation of the revenue recognition method for each segment:
1- Digital Business: Digital business revenue consists of two types: products and projects, revenue from products are recognized as follows for
subscriptions over a period of time, as for transactions, they are recognized at a point in time. Project revenue over time and at a point in time
based on the nature of the performance obligation specified in the contract.
2- Business Process Outsourcing: Revenue from the business process outsourcing segment consists of projects. Revenue can be recognized over time
and at a point in time based on the nature of the performance obligation specified in the contract.
3- Professional Services: Professional services segment revenue consists of projects. Revenue can be recognized over time and at a point in time
based on the nature of the performance obligation specified in the contract.
3.6 Foreign currencies
Balances and foreign transactions
Originally, transactions in foreign currencies are transferred by the Group's entities at the exchange rates prevailing in the functional currency of the
date on which the transaction occur.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates prevailing in the functional currency at the date
of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Differences arising from settlement or transfer of monetary items are recognized in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost, recorded in a foreign currency, are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at
the date of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items recorded in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value at the exchange rates prevailing
at the date when the fair value is determined are transferred. Profits or losses resulting from the conversion of non-monetary items that are measured
at fair value are treated in accordance with the recognition of gains or losses resulting from the change in the fair value of the item (i.e. exchange
differences are recognized on items whose profit or loss is measured at fair value in other comprehensive income or consolidated statement of profit
or loss, respectively).

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. This cost includes cost of replacing part of
the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs related to long-term construction projects, in case the evidentiary standards are met. If the
replacement of important parts of plant and equipment is required on stages, the group consumes these parts independently over their useful lives.
Conversely, when a major examination is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the equipment as a replacement, if the
recognition criteria are met. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as incurred. The
present value of the expected cost of removing an asset (if any) after its use is included in the cost of the underlying asset in the event that the
evidentiary criteria related to the recognition of the allowance are fulfilled.

Any item of property and equipment and any significant part that was initially recognized is discontinued upon exclusion or when there are no future
benefits expected from use or disposal. Any gains or losses arising from discontinuation of any asset (calculated as the difference between the net
proceeds from disposals and the carrying amount of the asset) are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which the
asset is discontinued.

The residual value, useful lives, and methods of depreciation of property and equipment are reviewed at the end of each financial period and
adjustments are made in the future, if appropriate.

Under construction projects appear at the cost incurred until the asset is prepared for the purpose for which it was created. This cost is then capitalized
to the related assets. Cost includes the cost of contractors, materials, services, and capital advances.

The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment on a straight line basis. The following are the expected useful life of the group's property and
equipment:

*   Leasehold improvements: 5 years or contract
    term, whichever is less
*   Information system devices: 3-5 years
*   Buildings: 25 - 33 years
*   Vehicles: 4 - 5 years
*   Furniture and fixtures: 4 - 7 years

3.8 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired independently are initially measured at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of entities represents
the fair value at the date of acquisition. After initial recognition, intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated
impairment losses. Internally developed intangible assets are capitalized.
Intangible assets with a specified life are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and reviewed to ensure that there is an impairment in its value
when there is an evidence that indicates that a decrease has occurred. The period and method for amortization of intangible assets with a finite
useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each financial reporting period. Changes in the accounting of expected useful life or the method of
amortizing future economic benefits embodied in the asset - through adjusting the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and it is considered
as changes in accounting estimates. Amortization expense for intangible assets with specific lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit
or loss as an expense and in line with the function of the intangible assets.
Intangible assets that do not have a specific life are not amortized, but are tested annually to ensure that there is no impairment in their value either
alone or at the cash-generating unit level. The indefinite life asset is reviewed annually to ensure that the assessment made for the unspecified useful
life is still supported, otherwise the change from "specified life" to "unspecified life" will be made on a future basis.
Research and development costs are recognized as incurred. Development costs for a specific project are recognized as an intangible asset when the
group can demonstrate the following:
•	The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.
•	The intention to complete the asset and the ability and intention to use or sell the asset.
•	The method of using the asset will generate future economic benefits.
•	The availability of resources to complete the asset.
•	The ability to measure the costs during development reliably.
After the initial recognition of development costs as an asset, the asset is recorded at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated
impairment losses, if any. Amortization of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for its intended use. It is amortized
over its expected future useful life. The amortization is recorded under the expense category in accordance with the function of the intangible assets.
During the development period, the asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Profits or losses resulting from discontinuation of the recognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss upon discontinuation of the asset.
Computer programs , platforms , Licenses and patents are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization, and accumulated impairment losses.
Historical cost includes the expenses directly related to purchasing items.
Projects under development related to intangible assets are presented within the capital work-in-progress item in the financial position until the asset
is ready for its intended use. It is then transferred to the relevant intangible assets category. The cost primarily includes software license fees and
developer salaries.
Amortization is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, and may be
charged against the related assets if it represents a portion of their costs
Computer software, electronic systems, and licenses are amortized over a period of 5 years unless they have an indefinite useful life. Patents are
amortized based on the term of the issued certificate.

3.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.9 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group, at the date of preparing the consolidated financial statements, makes an assessment to ensure that there is no evidence of any impairment
in the value of an asset. In case that such evidence exists or when an annual test is required to confirm the existence of an impairment in the value,
the Group estimates the recoverable amount for that asset. The recoverable amount represents the higher value of the fair value of the asset or cash
generating unit, less costs of disposal and the present value, and is determined for each asset, except in cases where the asset does not generate cash
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group assets. In cases where the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating
unit exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable amount.
When estimating the present value, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
market assessments for the time value of money and the risks inherent in the asset. When determining the fair value less cost of sales, it is taken into
consideration the latest market transactions that are available. Where no such factors can be identified, appropriate valuation methods are used.
The Group calculates present value based on the information used in calculating the detailed budgets and forecasts, which are prepared independently
for each cash generating unit in the group to which the asset is allocated. The information used to calculate budgets and expectations usually covers
a five-year period. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to the expected future cash flows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses from continuing operations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
For assets, except goodwill, an evaluation is performed at the date of preparing all consolidated financial statements, to ensure that there is any
indication that there were no previously reported impairment losses or decreases. If such evidence exists, the Group estimates the recoverable
amount of the asset or cash generating unit. The previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions
used to determine the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal of the entry is limited so that the book value
of the asset does not exceed the recoverable value of it nor the book value that was supposed to be determined after deduction of depreciation if
the impairment loss was not proven in previous years. This reversal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or losses.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested to ensure that there is no annual decrease in their value, either individually or at the cash-
generating unit level, as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
3.10 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are shown in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise cash at banks, cash in hand, and murabaha deposits
with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and short-term deposits as stated
above after deducting bank overdrafts (if any) since it's considered an integral part of the Group's cash management.
3.11 Murabaha deposits
Long-term murabaha deposits include long-term deposits with banks with an original maturity of more than three months. Bank deposits are
considered as a cash management tool for the group. Returns from bank deposits are accounted for in the consolidated statement of profit or loss
when due.

3.12 Dividend distribution
The Group recognizes distributions to shareholders as a liability when the distribution is approved. The corresponding amount is recognized directly in
equity.
3.13 Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has current or expected legal obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that the outflow of
resources with economic benefits will be necessary to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be performed.
When the Group expects that some or all of the provisions will be recovered, for example under an insurance contract, the recoveries are recognized
as a separate asset but only when these recoveries are almost confirmed. The expense related to the provision is displayed in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss after discounting any recoverable amounts. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted
using the current pre-tax rate, which reflects, when appropriate the risks related to the obligation. When using a discount, the increase in the provision
due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.
3.14 Segmental reporting
The Group's operating segments are identified based on internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Group's chief operating decision maker
(chief operating decision maker) in order to allocate resources between the segments and to assess their performance.
3.15 Employee end of service benefits
The group provides end of service benefits to the employees if eligible as a defined benefit program.
The net assets or liabilities of the retirement program recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position are the fair value of the program
assets, (if any), less the present value of the defined benefit obligations expected at the preparation date of the consolidated financial statements.
The Group is required to make assumptions about variables such as discount rates, salary increase rate, longevity, employee turnover and future
healthcare costs, where applicable. Changes in the underlying assumptions can have a significant impact on the expected benefit obligations and the
costs of defined employee benefits. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
The defined benefit liabilities are periodically re-measured by independent actuaries using the expected credit unit method. The present value of the
defined benefit liabilities is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using commission rates for high-quality corporate bonds that
are recorded in the currency in which the benefits are to be paid, and which have terms close to the terms of the related obligations. Commission
cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit liabilities and the fair value of the program assets. This cost
is included in employee benefits expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

3.15 Employee end of service benefits (continued)
The costs of the defined benefit liabilities for the initial periods are calculated on an annual basis using the rate of actuarially defined pension cost at
the end of prior year, after adjusting for significant market fluctuations and any significant one-time events, such as program adjustments or
manpower cuts and reimbursement. In the absence of such significant market fluctuations and one-time events, actuarial liabilities are carried forward
based on assumptions at the beginning of the year. If there are material changes to the assumptions or arrangements during the initial period, a re-
measurement of these liabilities is taken into consideration.
Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, are reflected immediately in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit liabilities resulting from settlements or downsizing the program are recognized directly in
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as a past service cost.
A liability assessment under these programs is performed by an independent actuary based on the expected credit unit method. The costs related to
these programs consist mainly of the present value of related benefits, on an equal basis, in each year of service and commissions on this obligation in
relation to employee services in prior years.
The costs of current and prior services related to post-employment benefits are recognized directly in the consolidated statement of other
comprehensive income while the increase in the commitment to the discount rates recorded as a financing costs. Any changes in net liabilities as a
result of actuarial valuations and changes in assumptions are re-measured to other comprehensive income.
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with regard to the employee end of service benefits provision, the actuarial valuation process takes into consideration
the Saudi labor law and the group policy.
3.16 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual instrument.
The following are the significant accounting policies followed by the group for the classification, recognition, and measurement of financial instruments:
A.  Financial assets
A.1 Classification and initial Recognition
The classification and initial recognition of financial assets depends on the Group's business model for managing its financial assets and the contractual
terms of the cash flows. The Group classifies and recognizes its financial assets as follows:
• Financial asset at amortized cost:
•
Financial asset at Fair value through Profit or loss ("FVTPL"); and
• Financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVOCI").
Below is a detailed statement of the classification and initial proof of each of the above-mentioned items;

3.16 Financial instruments (continued)
A. Financial assets (continued)
Financial asset at amortized cost
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost, if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows (HTC): and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding It results in cash flows that are only payments of the principal amount and commission on the principal amount
outstanding. This evaluation is referred to as the "pay test only from principal and commission", and this evaluation is performed at the level of
the financial instrument.
Accounts receivable and contract assets, which are held to collect contractual cash flows that are expected to result in cash flows that are solely
payments of principal, or cash flows that are solely payments of principal and commission on the principal amount that do not carry a significant
financing portion, are measured at transaction cost.
Financial asset at FVOCI
Equity instruments
On initial recognition, for an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair
value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.
Debt instruments
A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (HTCS);
and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding.
Financial asset at FVTPL
All financial assets not classified as held at amortized cost or FVOCI are classified as FVTPL.
In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at
amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes its business model for managing
financial assets.

A.2 Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into three categories:
Financial asset at amortized cost
-Debt Instruments
Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the Effective Interest Rate ("EIR") method and are subject to impairment. Gain
and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.
As at the date of preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Group does not have any debt instrument assets.
-Accounts receivable and contract assets
Accounts receivable and contract assets, which are held to collect contractual cash flows that are expected to result in cash flows that are solely
payments of principal, or cash flows that are solely payments of principal and commission on the principal amount that do not carry a significant
financing portion, are measured at transaction cost. Subsequent measurement and impairment are described in the note on impairment (Note 3.16,
Paragraph A.4).
Financial asset at FVTPL
The financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL") are measured at each reporting date at fair value without the deduction
of transaction costs that the Group may incur on sale or disposal of the financial asset in the future.
Financial asset at FVOCI
Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income at the end of each reporting period and the transaction costs that
the Group incurs when the assets are disposed of in the future are not discounted.
A.3 De-recognition
A financial asset or a part of a financial asset is de-recognized when:
• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
• The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without
material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement, and either:
a) The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or
b) The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the asset.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount assigned to the part of the
asset for which recognition was expected) and the sum of (i) the consideration received and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss recognized in other
comprehensive income It is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

A.4 Impairment
Management assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECL associated with its account receivables, contract assets and employee receivables.
Management applies the simplified approach in calculating ECL's. Therefore, management does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognized
a loss allowance base on lifetime ECL's at each reporting date. Management has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. Also, management evaluate on on-going
basis the credit risk where it takes additional ECL for specific cases where applicable.
A.5 Business model assessment
The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model under which an asset is held, at a portfolio level because this best reflects the
way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:
• the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management's strategy
  focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to
  the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets;
• how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;
• the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are
  managed:
• how managers of the business are compensated-e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual
  cash flows collected: and
• the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However,
  information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of Financial assets that are held for trading and whose performance is
  evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held to collect
  contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. If cash
flows after initial recognition are realized in a way that is different from the Group's original expectations, the Group does not change the classification
of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased
financial assets going forward.

A.6 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI" criteria)
For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is the consideration for the time
value of money, the credit and other basic lending risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period and other basic
lending costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), along with profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the
instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual
cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment the Group considers:
•	contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows:
•	leverage features;
•	prepayment and extension terms;
•	terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements); and
•	features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).
B.	Financial liabilities
B.1 Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are classified under either of the below two classes:
•	Financial liabilities at gain value through profit or loss ("FVTPL"); and
•	Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method ("EIR") method.
The category of financial liability at FVTPL has two sub-categories:
•	Designated: A financial liability that is designated by the entity as a liability at FVTPL upon initial recognition; and
•	Held for trading: A financial liability classified as held for trading, such as an obligation for securities borrowed in a short sale, which have to be
returned in the future. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging
instruments in hedge relationships. Separated embedded derivatives are classified as held for trading.
All financial liabilities are recognized initially when the Group becomes party to contractual provisions and obligations under the financial instrument.
The liabilities are recorded at fair value.
As of the date of this financial statement the group doesn't have any financial liabilities at FVTPL.
B.2 Subsequent measurement
Financial liabilities at FVTPL continue to be recorded at fair value with changes being recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
For other financial liabilities, including loans and borrowings, after initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR
method. Gain or loss are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the liabilities are de-recognized as well as through the EIR
amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR
method. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
For accounts payables and contract liabilities. They are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Expected credit losses provision for trade receivables and contract assets
As at 31 December 2024, the Group's accounts Our procedures included the following:
receivable and contract assets balance amounted to SR
4.25 billion, against which an impairment allowance
of SR 715 million is maintained.
•
We obtained an understanding of the process
used by management in determining the
allowance for expected credit losses for the
accounts receivable and contract assets.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether the
accounts receivable and contract assets are impaired.
Management has applied an expected credit loss
("ECL") model to determine the appropriate
allowance for impairment loss. Further, the Group
performs an assessment based on a defined policy for
certain categories of accounts receivables and contract
assets.
•
•
•
•
•
Involved internal specialists to review the
expected credit loss (ECL) model and tested
key assumptions in relation to forward-looking
information, review the modelling inputs,
techniques used and assessed overall adequacy
of the model in light of the profile of trade
receivable and contract asset;
We tested the completeness and mathematical
accuracy of the ECL model.
We assessed the assumptions used by
management in connection to the determination
of allowance for expected credit losses for
certain categories of accounts receivable and
contract assets.
We tested, on a sample basis, the calculation
performed by management on allowance for
expected credit losses for these categories of
customers and contract assets.
We evaluated the adequacy and appropriateness
of disclosures included in the consolidated
financial statements.
The determination of allowance for expected credit
losses is based on certain assumptions that relate
mainly to risk of default and expected loss rates. The
Group applies judgement in making these assumptions
and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation,
based on the Group's past history, market conditions,
as well as forward looking estimates.

We considered this as a key audit matter due to the
level of judgment applied and estimates made in the
application of the ECL.

Independent auditor's report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements of Elm Company for
the year ended 31 December 2024 (continued)

Other information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's
report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the annual report, when made available to us, if we conclude that there is a material
misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial
Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other
standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA and Regulations for Companies and the Company's By-laws,
and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or
has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with Governance, i.e., the Company's Board of Directors, are responsible for overseeing the
Group's financial reporting process.

Auditor's responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control.

Independent auditor's report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements of Elm Company for
the year ended 31 December 2024 (continued)

Auditor's responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
•	Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
•	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.
•	Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a
going concern.
•	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the
financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and
performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that
we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate
threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, and are therefore
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should
not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
2.1 Statement of compliance and basis of preperation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are endorsed
in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements endorsed by the Saudi Organization for Chartered and professional Accountants
("SOCPA").
Certain prior year figures have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation (Note 39).
2.2 Basis of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Elm Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred as the
Group").
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group. The Group controls an enterprise when it has controlling interest over the investee Company and
when the Company is exposed to variable returns or has rights to these returns as a result of its participation with the entity and it also has the ability
to influence these returns through the power it exerts on the enterprise.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or excluded during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income from the actual acquisition date or until the actual date of disposal, as appropriate.
All inter-Company balances, assets, liabilities and equities, revenue, expenses, and cash flows related to group transactions between the Company
and its subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation of the financial statements.
The non-controlling interests in the net assets of the subsidiary are determined separately from the equity of the Company.
The accounting policies applied by the subsidiaries are in accordance with the group's accounting policies. Adjustments are made to the financial
statements of the subsidiaries to comply with the financial statements of The Group, as required.
In case of loss of control over a subsidiary, it ceases to recognize the related assets (including goodwill, if applicable), liabilities, non-controlling interests
and other components of equity, and the resulting gain or loss is then recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
2.3 Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for:
• Employee end-of-service benefits which have been measured at the present value of future obligations using projected unit credit method
which is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income,
• Other financial assets which are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or profit or loss; and
• Long-term interest (advances payment for future equity shares) in associate companies, where they are measured at fair value through profit
or loss.
• Share-based payment measured at fair value for the share price at the grant date.
2.4 Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Saudi Riyals which represents the functional currency for the group.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
2.5 Use of assumptions and estimates and important accounting judgments
2.5.1 Important accounting judgments in applying accounting policies
The following are important judgments, regardless of those that include estimates made by the Group's management during the process of applying
the Group's accounting policies which have a significant and major impact on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements:

Determining Significant influence
Management considers that the group has significant influence over an entity when the group is exposed to risks or has rights to a significant part of
the variable returns arising from its involvement with the investee and when it has the ability to make changes to the investee Company to affect
or participate in affecting that returns through its ability to participate in directing the related activities of the investee companies.
The determination of significant influence depends on the way decisions are made regarding the relevant activities and the Group's rights in the
investee companies.
In general, there is an assumption that owning a significant portion of the voting rights (typically above 20% of the voting rights) leads to a significant
influence.
Management use the equity method for investees where it has a significant influence, when ownership is in ordinary shares and other instruments
that are substantially similar to the ordinary shares of the investee (""in-substance ordinary shares"). Management assesses that for an instrument
to qualify as an in-substance ordinary share for this purpose, an instrument would need to carry rights that are substantially the same as the investee's
ordinary shares and provide returns associated with those ordinary shares. When investing in Start-up's management assess whether the investment
is substantially similar to the investment in the ordinary shares of the investee, and take into consideration all the characteristics below:
1- Subordination rights
2-Risks and rewards of ownership
3- Obligation to transfer value
Management has assessed that there are substantive subordination rights of the preferred shares the group owns as compared to the ordinary shares,
causing the instruments not to be substantially similar. Accordingly, the management measures these investment at fair value, and present it as part
of other financial assets.

Determination of control
Subsidiaries are all investee companies that the Group controls. Management considers that the Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed
to, or has rights, to most variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect
those returns through its ability to direct relevant activities. Relationship with the investee companies.
The determination of the group's control depends on the way decisions are made regarding the related activities and The Group's rights in the investee
companies.
In general, there is an assumption that having a majority of voting rights leads to control. In support of this presumption, when The Group has equal
or less than a majority of the voting rights of the investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances when assessing whether it
exercises control over the investee, including contractual and other arrangements that have an effect on activities that affect the returns of the
investee companies.

2.5 Use of assumptions and estimates and important accounting judgments (continued)
2.5.1 Important accounting judgments in applying accounting policies (continued)
Principal versus agent
The Group has made an assessment of its arrangements to determine whether it is acting as principal and then presents revenue at gross or agent
and then presents revenue on a net basis. In this evaluation, the group took into account obtaining or not obtaining control over the stipulated goods
or services before they are transferred to the customer. As well as other indicators like if the party is primarily responsible for fulfillment and
appreciation when setting the price, and in cases where the group conducts Agency activities related In accordance with a contract whereby the end
customer receives project management and coordination support. The group only proves net commission income where you arrange for a third party
to transfer goods or services under that arrangement and thus act as an agent.
Determine the lease term for contracts that include renewal and termination options
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if
it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination clauses. The Group applies judgment in evaluating whether it is
reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. It considers all relevant factors that create an economic
incentive for it to exercise either the renal or termination. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant
event or change in the circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate
the contract.
2.5.2 Using assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed in the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities
as at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates
are based on management's knowledge of current events and procedures, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates due to
circumstances out of the groups control. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and adjustments to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the adjustment affects only that period or in the period of the review
and future periods if the adjustment affects current and future periods.
The following are important assumptions that relates to future periods and other major sources of uncertainty in the estimates in the financial
reporting period that may have significant risks that result in substantial adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for the upcoming
financial year:
Estimated useful lives and residual values of property and equipment and intangible assets
The useful lives and residual values of property, equipment and intangible assets are calculated for the purposes of calculating depreciation and
amortization, respectively. These estimates are made based on the expected usage of individual assets. The residual value is determined based on
experience and observable data when available.

2.5 Use of assumptions and estimates and important accounting judgments (continued)
2.5.2 Using assumptions and estimates (continued)
The assumptions used to estimate the impairment of non-current assets
Determining the impairment of non-current assets requires making a value-in-use for non-current assets or the cash-generating unit where the non-
current assets belong. The value used in the calculation requires the management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the
non-current assets or the cash generating unit and an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the present value. An impairment loss can be
significant when the actual future cash flows are less than expected.
The assumptions used to determine the actuarial value of end of service benefits provision
Defined benefit obligations are discounted at a rate set by reference to relevant market yields at the end of the reporting period. Significant judgment
is required when setting the criteria for which yield curve is derived. this includes government premium risk and identifying changes to be eliminated.
Zakat provision
Zakat provision is estimated at the end of each reporting period in accordance with the regulations of the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA),
and on an annual basis zakat returns are submitted to the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority. The adjustments resulting from the final zakat
assessment are recorded during the reporting period in which this assessment is approved by the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority.
Calculation of expected credit losses provision
The estimate of the expected credit loss allowance is calculated in accordance with the accounting policy detailed in (Note 3)(A-4).
The Group uses a dedicated matrix for the purpose of calculating expected credit losses for accounts receivable, contract assets and employee
receivables. This matrix is initially based on historical default rates. The Group calibrates the matrix to adjust the historical experience of credit losses
for forward-looking information, at each reporting date the Group updates the historical default rates and this is reflected in the forward-looking
estimates. Management also estimates the credit loss for specific cases separately.
The Group also utilizes a dedicated matrix for the purpose of calculating the present value of money for government receivables, through which it
estimates the expected collection date by applying certain assumptions and inputs such as historical collection experience per client.
Expected credit losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The difference between the amounts collected in future periods
and the amounts expected will be recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
The assumptions used to determine the actuarial value of end of service benefits provision
The Group has made various estimates to determine the actuarial value of the employee end of service benefits provision. These estimates are
disclosed in Note 29.

2.5.2 Using assumptions and estimates (continued)
The assumptions used to measure revenue
The Group estimates revenue based on the expected average collection of control and inspection projects, based on historical data associated with
these projects.
Incremental borrowing rate for leases
The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease agreement, therefore, it uses its Incremental Borrowing Rate ("IBR") to
measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds
necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group
'would have to pay', which requires estimation when no observable rates are available, such as for subsidiaries that do not enter into financing
transactions or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease. The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs,
such as market interest rates when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following is a statement of the significant accounting policies used by the group in preparing these consolidated financial statements:
3.1 Classification of assets and liabilities as "current" and "non-current"
The group presents the assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position as current / non-current. The assets are classified
current when:
•
It is expected to be realized or intended to be sold or exhausted during the normal operations cycle.
•
If it is acquired mainly for trading purposes;
•
It is expected to be realized within 12 months after the financial period; or
•
When it is cash and cash equivalents unless there are restrictions on their replacement or their use to pay off any liabilities for a period not less
than 12 months after the financial period.
All other assets are classified as "non-current".
All liabilities are classified current when:
•
It is expected to be paid during the normal operations cycle;
•
If acquired mainly for trading purpose;
•
It is due for payment within 12 months after the financial period; or
•
There is no unconditional right to postpone the payment of liabilities for a period not less than 12 months after the financial period.
All other liabilties are classified as "non-current".

3.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.2 Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes
place either:
•	In the principal market for the asset or liability :or
•	In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability,
assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits from the asset's
highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would utilize the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses appropriate valuation methods in accordance with the circumstances, and sufficient data are available for it to measure the fair value
and increase the use of observable inputs and reduce the use of unobservable inputs.
All other assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value
hierarchy mentioned below and based on the lowest level inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement as whole.
•	Level 1- quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (i.e. without modifying or renewing prices);
•	Level 2 - fair value measurements that consider significant lower level inputs that are observable directly or indirectly: and
•	Level 3 - fair value measurements that don't consider significant lower level inputs that are unobservable.
With respect to the assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a frequent basis, the Group
determines whether the transfer has occurred between the hierarchical levels to measure the fair value by recalibrating the classification (based on
significant lower level inputs to measure the fair value as a whole) at the end of each financial period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosure, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks
of assets and liabilities and a hierarchy of levels of fair value measurement mentioned above (Note 38).
3.3 Business Combination process for common-controlled entities
Business combination transactions that involve acquiring businesses under common control, where the consideration is not subject to market forces,
are accounted for by recognizing the assets and liabilities of the acquired company at their book value, and no goodwill resulting from the acquisition
is recorded. Any increase or decrease between the transferred consideration and the book value of the acquired company's net assets is directly
recognized in equity.
The consolidated financial statements after the acquisition are presented from the announced acquisition date, without consolidating or restating the
comparative year figures. Any costs incurred during the acquisition process are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

3.4 Investments in associates and a joint venture
3.4.1 Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but does not have control or joint control over it. Significant influence is the
Group ability to participate in the financial and operating policies decisions of the investee but has no control or joint control over those policies.
The considerations made in determining significant influence are holding- directly or indirectly – voting rights in the investee, representation on the
board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee, participation in policy-making, including participation in decisions about dividends or
other distributions; material transactions between the Group and its investee; interchange of managerial personnel; or provision of essential technical
information.
3.4.2 Joint arrangements
Joint control is that which arises from a contractual agreement to share control of an arrangement and only occurs when decisions about the relevant
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations considered in determining whether joint control exists are
like those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures or joint operations. This depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each
investor, regardless of the legal form of the joint arrangement. The Group has an investment in a joint venture (Note 16).
3.4.2.1 Joint venture
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the
joint venture Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognized at cost in the consolidated
statement of financial position.
3.4.3 Equity method
The investment in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statement of the Group using the equity method of accounting. The
investment in associates in the consolidated statement of financial position is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the
Group's share of the profit and loss and other comprehensive income of the associate adjusted for any impairment in the value of net investment. In
addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when
applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. When the Group's share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group's interest in that
associate or joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate or joint
venture), the Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses.
Additional losses are recognized and recorded as liabilities only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made
payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealized gain or losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
Unrealized gains or losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate company are excluded to the extent of the Group's
ownership share in the associate company.
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognizes any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference
between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from
disposal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
When the Group discontinues accounting for an investment under the equity method due to a loss of control or significant influence, any retained
interest in the entity is re-measured at fair value, and the change in carrying amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. This
fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate or a financial
asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had
directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified
directly to the consolidated statement of profit or loss or the consolidated statement of financial position.

3.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue from contracts with customers
The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using five steps method as mentioned in IFRS 15:
Step (1): Identify the contract (s) with the customer. A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable
rights and obligations and clarifies the foundations and criteria that must be fulfilled for each contract.
Step (2): Identify the performance obligations in the contract. A performance obligation is an undertaking stipulated in the contract with the customer
to transfer a good or service to the customer.
Step (3): Determine the transaction price: The transaction price represents the amount of compensation that the group expects to have the right in
exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer except the amounts that are collected on behalf of third parties.
Step (4): Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations stipulated in the contract. For contracts that involve more than one
performance obligation, the Group will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation, in an amount that the Group expects to have
the right to fulfill each performance obligation.
Step (5): Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Group fulfills a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over a period of time if one of the following controls is met:
A) The performance of the Group does not originally create an asset with an alternative use to the Group, and the group has the right to enforce
payment in exchange for the performance completed to date.
B) Group performance creates or improves a customer-controlled asset at the same time that the asset is constructed or improved.
C) The customer receives the benefits provided by the performance of the facility and consumes it at the same time once the group has performed.
With regard to performance obligations, if any of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at a point of time.
In the event that the Group fulfills the performance obligation through providing the promised services, this will lead to the creation of an asset based
on a contract in exchange for compensation earned from the performance. In the event that the compensation received by the customer exceeds
the amount of proven revenue, a contract obligation may arise. The Group takes in consideration the transition of the asset (or service) that fulfills
the performance obligation, if applicable.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, after taking into consideration the terms of the contractual
payment, and after excluding taxes and fees. The Group reviews revenue arrangements in accordance with specific criteria to ascertain whether it
is acting as principal or agent.
When the Group is not highly certain of the possibility of collecting from certain customers, the revenue is recognized upon collection.

3.5 Revenue recognition (continued)
Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits of the Group will flow, and that revenue and costs, if applicable,
can be measured reliably.
The following is an explanation of the revenue recognition method for each segment:
1- Digital Business: Digital business revenue consists of two types: products and projects, revenue from products are recognized as follows for
subscriptions over a period of time, as for transactions, they are recognized at a point in time. Project revenue over time and at a point in time
based on the nature of the performance obligation specified in the contract.
2- Business Process Outsourcing: Revenue from the business process outsourcing segment consists of projects. Revenue can be recognized over time
and at a point in time based on the nature of the performance obligation specified in the contract.
3- Professional Services: Professional services segment revenue consists of projects. Revenue can be recognized over time and at a point in time
based on the nature of the performance obligation specified in the contract.
3.6 Foreign currencies
Balances and foreign transactions
Originally, transactions in foreign currencies are transferred by the Group's entities at the exchange rates prevailing in the functional currency of the
date on which the transaction occur.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates prevailing in the functional currency at the date
of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Differences arising from settlement or transfer of monetary items are recognized in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost, recorded in a foreign currency, are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at
the date of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items recorded in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value at the exchange rates prevailing
at the date when the fair value is determined are transferred. Profits or losses resulting from the conversion of non-monetary items that are measured
at fair value are treated in accordance with the recognition of gains or losses resulting from the change in the fair value of the item (i.e. exchange
differences are recognized on items whose profit or loss is measured at fair value in other comprehensive income or consolidated statement of profit
or loss, respectively).

3.7 Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. This cost includes cost of replacing part of
the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs related to long-term construction projects, in case the evidentiary standards are met. If the
replacement of important parts of plant and equipment is required on stages, the group consumes these parts independently over their useful lives.
Conversely, when a major examination is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the equipment as a replacement, if the
recognition criteria are met. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as incurred. The
present value of the expected cost of removing an asset (if any) after its use is included in the cost of the underlying asset in the event that the
evidentiary criteria related to the recognition of the allowance are fulfilled.
Any item of property and equipment and any significant part that was initially recognized is discontinued upon exclusion or when there are no future
benefits expected from use or disposal. Any gains or losses arising from discontinuation of any asset (calculated as the difference between the net
proceeds from disposals and the carrying amount of the asset) are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which the
asset is discontinued.
The residual value, useful lives, and methods of depreciation of property and equipment are reviewed at the end of each financial period and
adjustments are made in the future, if appropriate.
Under construction projects appear at the cost incurred until the asset is prepared for the purpose for which it was created. This cost is then capitalized
to the related assets. Cost includes the cost of contractors, materials, services, and capital advances.
The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment on a straight line basis. The following are the expected useful life of the group's property and
equipment:
• Leasehold improvements: 5 years or contract • Information system devices: 3-5 years • Buildings: 25-33 years
term, whichever is less
• Vehicles: 4-5 years • Furniture and fixtures: 4-7 years

3.8 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired independently are initially measured at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of entities represents
the fair value at the date of acquisition. After initial recognition, intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated
impairment losses. Internally developed intangible assets are capitalized.
Intangible assets with a specified life are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and reviewed to ensure that there is an impairment in its value
when there is an evidence that indicates that a decrease has occurred. The period and method for amortization of intangible assets with a finite
useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each financial reporting period. Changes in the accounting of expected useful life or the method of
amortizing future economic benefits embodied in the asset - through adjusting the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and it is considered
as changes in accounting estimates. Amortization expense for intangible assets with specific lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit
or loss as an expense and in line with the function of the intangible assets.
Intangible assets that do not have a specific life are not amortized, but are tested annually to ensure that there is no impairment in their value either
alone or at the cash-generating unit level. The indefinite life asset is reviewed annually to ensure that the assessment made for the unspecified useful
life is still supported, otherwise the change from "specified life" to "unspecified life" will be made on a future basis.
Research and development costs are recognized as incurred. Development costs for a specific project are recognized as an intangible asset when the
group can demonstrate the following:
•	The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.
•	The intention to complete the asset and the ability and intention to use or sell the asset.
•	The method of using the asset will generate future economic benefits.
•	The availability of resources to complete the asset.
•	The ability to measure the costs during development reliably.
After the initial recognition of development costs as an asset, the asset is recorded at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated
impairment losses, if any. Amortization of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for its intended use. It is amortized
over its expected future useful life. The amortization is recorded under the expense category in accordance with the function of the intangible assets.
During the development period, the asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Profits or losses resulting from discontinuation of the recognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss upon discontinuation of the asset.
Computer programs , platforms , Licenses and patents are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization, and accumulated impairment losses.
Historical cost includes the expenses directly related to purchasing items.
Projects under development related to intangible assets are presented within the capital work-in-progress item in the financial position until the asset
is ready for its intended use. It is then transferred to the relevant intangible assets category. The cost primarily includes software license fees and
developer salaries.
Amortization is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, and may be
charged against the related assets if it represents a portion of their costs
Computer software, electronic systems, and licenses are amortized over a period of 5 years unless they have an indefinite useful life. Patents are
amortized based on the term of the issued certificate.

3.9 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group, at the date of preparing the consolidated financial statements, makes an assessment to ensure that there is no evidence of any impairment
in the value of an asset. In case that such evidence exists or when an annual test is required to confirm the existence of an impairment in the value,
the Group estimates the recoverable amount for that asset. The recoverable amount represents the higher value of the fair value of the asset or cash
generating unit, less costs of disposal and the present value, and is determined for each asset, except in cases where the asset does not generate cash
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group assets. In cases where the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating
unit exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable amount.
When estimating the present value, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
market assessments for the time value of money and the risks inherent in the asset. When determining the fair value less cost of sales, it is taken into
consideration the latest market transactions that are available. Where no such factors can be identified, appropriate valuation methods are used.
The Group calculates present value based on the information used in calculating the detailed budgets and forecasts, which are prepared independently
for each cash generating unit in the group to which the asset is allocated. The information used to calculate budgets and expectations usually covers
a five-year period. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to the expected future cash flows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses from continuing operations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
For assets, except goodwill, an evaluation is performed at the date of preparing all consolidated financial statements, to ensure that there is any
indication that there were no previously reported impairment losses or decreases. If such evidence exists, the Group estimates the recoverable
amount of the asset or cash generating unit. The previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions
used to determine the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal of the entry is limited so that the book value
of the asset does not exceed the recoverable value of it nor the book value that was supposed to be determined after deduction of depreciation if
the impairment loss was not proven in previous years. This reversal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or losses.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested to ensure that there is no annual decrease in their value, either individually or at the cash-
generating unit level, as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
3.10 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are shown in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise cash at banks, cash in hand, and murabaha deposits
with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and short-term deposits as stated
above after deducting bank overdrafts (if any) since it's considered an integral part of the Group's cash management.
3.11 Murabaha deposits
Long-term murabaha deposits include long-term deposits with banks with an original maturity of more than three months. Bank deposits are
considered as a cash management tool for the group. Returns from bank deposits are accounted for in the consolidated statement of profit or loss
when due.

3.12 Dividend distribution
The Group recognizes distributions to shareholders as a liability when the distribution is approved. The corresponding amount is recognized directly in
equity.
3.13 Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has current or expected legal obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that the outflow of
resources with economic benefits will be necessary to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be performed.
When the Group expects that some or all of the provisions will be recovered, for example under an insurance contract, the recoveries are recognized
as a separate asset but only when these recoveries are almost confirmed. The expense related to the provision is displayed in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss after discounting any recoverable amounts. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted
using the current pre-tax rate, which reflects, when appropriate the risks related to the obligation. When using a discount, the increase in the provision
due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.
3.14 Segmental reporting
The Group's operating segments are identified based on internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Group's chief operating decision maker
(chief operating decision maker) in order to allocate resources between the segments and to assess their performance.
3.15 Employee end of service benefits
The group provides end of service benefits to the employees if eligible as a defined benefit program.
The net assets or liabilities of the retirement program recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position are the fair value of the program
assets, (if any), less the present value of the defined benefit obligations expected at the preparation date of the consolidated financial statements.
The Group is required to make assumptions about variables such as discount rates, salary increase rate, longevity, employee turnover and future
healthcare costs, where applicable. Changes in the underlying assumptions can have a significant impact on the expected benefit obligations and the
costs of defined employee benefits. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
The defined benefit liabilities are periodically re-measured by independent actuaries using the expected credit unit method. The present value of the
defined benefit liabilities is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using commission rates for high-quality corporate bonds that
are recorded in the currency in which the benefits are to be paid, and which have terms close to the terms of the related obligations. Commission
cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit liabilities and the fair value of the program assets. This cost
is included in employee benefits expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

3.15 Employee end of service benefits (continued)
The costs of the defined benefit liabilities for the initial periods are calculated on an annual basis using the rate of actuarially defined pension cost at
the end of prior year, after adjusting for significant market fluctuations and any significant one-time events, such as program adjustments or
manpower cuts and reimbursement. In the absence of such significant market fluctuations and one-time events, actuarial liabilities are carried forward
based on assumptions at the beginning of the year. If there are material changes to the assumptions or arrangements during the initial period, a re-
measurement of these liabilities is taken into consideration.
Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, are reflected immediately in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit liabilities resulting from settlements or downsizing the program are recognized directly in
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as a past service cost.
A liability assessment under these programs is performed by an independent actuary based on the expected credit unit method. The costs related to
these programs consist mainly of the present value of related benefits, on an equal basis, in each year of service and commissions on this obligation in
relation to employee services in prior years.
The costs of current and prior services related to post-employment benefits are recognized directly in the consolidated statement of other
comprehensive income while the increase in the commitment to the discount rates recorded as a financing costs. Any changes in net liabilities as a
result of actuarial valuations and changes in assumptions are re-measured to other comprehensive income.
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with regard to the employee end of service benefits provision, the actuarial valuation process takes into consideration
the Saudi labor law and the group policy.
3.16 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual instrument.
The following are the significant accounting policies followed by the group for the classification, recognition, and measurement of financial instruments:
A. Financial assets
A.1 Classification and initial Recognition
The classification and initial recognition of financial assets depends on the Group's business model for managing its financial assets and the contractual
terms of the cash flows. The Group classifies and recognizes its financial assets as follows:
• Financial asset at amortized cost:
• Financial asset at Fair value through Profit or loss ("FVTPL"); and
• Financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVOCI").
Below is a detailed statement of the classification and initial proof of each of the above-mentioned items;

3.16 Financial instruments (continued)
A. Financial assets (continued)
Financial asset at amortized cost
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost, if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows (HTC): and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding It results in cash flows that are only payments of the principal amount and commission on the principal amount
outstanding. This evaluation is referred to as the "pay test only from principal and commission", and this evaluation is performed at the level of
the financial instrument.
Accounts receivable and contract assets, which are held to collect contractual cash flows that are expected to result in cash flows that are solely
payments of principal, or cash flows that are solely payments of principal and commission on the principal amount that do not carry a significant
financing portion, are measured at transaction cost.
Financial asset at FVOCI
Equity instruments
On initial recognition, for an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair
value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.
Debt instruments
A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (HTCS);
and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding.
Financial asset at FVTPL
All financial assets not classified as held at amortized cost or FVOCI are classified as FVTPL.
In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at
amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes its business model for managing
financial assets.

A.2 Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into three categories:
Financial asset at amortized cost
-Debt Instruments
Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the Effective Interest Rate ("EIR") method and are subject to impairment. Gain
and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.
As at the date of preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Group does not have any debt instrument assets.
-Accounts receivable and contract assets
Accounts receivable and contract assets, which are held to collect contractual cash flows that are expected to result in cash flows that are solely
payments of principal, or cash flows that are solely payments of principal and commission on the principal amount that do not carry a significant
financing portion, are measured at transaction cost. Subsequent measurement and impairment are described in the note on impairment (Note 3.16,
Paragraph A.4).
Financial asset at FVTPL
The financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL") are measured at each reporting date at fair value without the deduction
of transaction costs that the Group may incur on sale or disposal of the financial asset in the future.
Financial asset at FVOCI
Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income at the end of each reporting period and the transaction costs that
the Group incurs when the assets are disposed of in the future are not discounted.
A.3 De-recognition
A financial asset or a part of a financial asset is de-recognized when:
• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
• The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without
material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement, and either:
a) The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or
b) The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the asset.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount assigned to the part of the
asset for which recognition was expected) and the sum of (i) the consideration received and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss recognized in other
comprehensive income It is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

A.4 Impairment
Management assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECL associated with its account receivables, contract assets and employee receivables.
Management applies the simplified approach in calculating ECL's. Therefore, management does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognized
a loss allowance base on lifetime ECL's at each reporting date. Management has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. Also, management evaluate on on-going
basis the credit risk where it takes additional ECL for specific cases where applicable.
A.5 Business model assessment
The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model under which an asset is held, at a portfolio level because this best reflects the
way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:
• the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management's strategy
focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to
the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets;
• how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;
• the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are
managed:
• how managers of the business are compensated-e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual
cash flows collected: and
• the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However,
information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of Financial assets that are held for trading and whose performance is
evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held to collect
contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.
The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. If cash
flows after initial recognition are realized in a way that is different from the Group's original expectations, the Group does not change the classification
of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased
financial assets going forward.

A.6 Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI" criteria)
For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is the consideration for the time
value of money, the credit and other basic lending risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period and other basic
lending costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), along with profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the
instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual
cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment the Group considers:
• contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows:
• leverage features;
• prepayment and extension terms;
• terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements); and
• features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

B. Financial liabilities
B.1 Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are classified under either of the below two classes:
• Financial liabilities at gain value through profit or loss ("FVTPL"); and
• Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method ("EIR") method.
The category of financial liability at FVTPL has two sub-categories:
• Designated: A financial liability that is designated by the entity as a liability at FVTPL upon initial recognition; and
• Held for trading: A financial liability classified as held for trading, such as an obligation for securities borrowed in a short sale, which have to be
returned in the future. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging
instruments in hedge relationships. Separated embedded derivatives are classified as held for trading.
All financial liabilities are recognized initially when the Group becomes party to contractual provisions and obligations under the financial instrument.
The liabilities are recorded at fair value.
As of the date of this financial statement the group doesn't have any financial liabilities at FVTPL.

B.2 Subsequent measurement
Financial liabilities at FVTPL continue to be recorded at fair value with changes being recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
For other financial liabilities, including loans and borrowings, after initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR
method. Gain or loss are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the liabilities are de-recognized as well as through the EIR
amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR
method. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
For accounts payables and contract liabilities. They are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.

B.3 De-recognition
A financial liability is de-recognized when the obligation under the liability is settled or discharged.
3.17 Leases
The Group assesses whether a contract is based on or contains a lease based on the lease concept and determines whether the arrangement is based
on or contains a lease based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. An arrangement is or contains a lease if the arrangement
is based on a right to use an asset or assets and the arrangement provides a right to use the asset or assets for a specified period even if this right is
not expressly stated in the arrangement.
A. The group as a Lessee
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-
use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.
The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs, and any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date less any lease incentives received.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease on a straight line basis, whichever is shorter.
If ownership of the leased asset passes to the Group at the end of the lease term or the right-of-use cost reflects the Group's exercise of the option
to purchase the leased asset, then the asset is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the
lease term.
The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that
depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of
a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the
Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period
in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
All lease payments are allocated between the obligation and the finance cost. The finance cost is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit
or loss over the term of the lease.
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Impaired assets are those items that do not reach the Group's capitalization
threshold. Payments related to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement
of profit or loss.
B. Group as a lessor
Leases in which the Group does not transfer all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Rental
income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included within other income in the consolidated statement of profit or
loss. Initial direct costs incurred during the negotiation and arrangement of an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset
and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as a lease expense.
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset. The amounts
due from the finance leases are recorded as lease receivables at an amount equal to the net investment of the Group in the lease. The lease payments
to be received are divided into two components: (1) a reimbursement of the original amount (2) a financing income to compensate the Group for its
investment and services. The additional costs directly attributable to negotiating the lease contract are included in the amounts due, which in return,
will reduce the finance income portion from the contract.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.18 Zakat
The Group calculates and records zakat provision based on the zakat base in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Zakat, Tax, and
Customs Authority ("ZATCA") regulations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Adjustments arising from final zakat assessment are recorded in the
reporting period in which such assessment is approved by the Zakat, Tax, and Customs Authority ("ZATCA").
3.19 Treasury shares
Own equity instruments that are repurchased (treasury shares) are recognized at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the shares. Any difference between the carrying amount of the
shares and the consideration, if reissued, is recognized in other reserves within equity.
3.20 Share based payment
Company employees receive remuneration in the form of shares under the long-term employee incentive program, under which employees provide
services in consideration for Company shares (repayable transactions in the form of equity instruments). The cost is determined through the fair value
of the financial instrument at the grant date. The grant date is the date on which both the Company and the employee agree to a share-based
payment agreement, so that there is a common understanding of the terms and conditions of the agreement between the parties (Note 26).
The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to employees is generally recognized as an expense included
in the salaries and benefits of the employees, with a corresponding increase in the other reserves at the equity statement, over the vesting period of
the awards.
The cumulative expense recognized at each reporting date until the long-term employee incentive program end date reflects the Group's best
estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
In case of program terms adjusted, the minimum expense recognized is equal to the value of the expense as if the terms had not been adjusted, if the
original terms are met. Any additional expense is recognized for any adjustment leading to an increase in the fair value of the awards or bringing
benefit to the employees and measured at fair value on the date of the adjustment.
The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance
conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and
non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
In case of cancellation of the program, the process of the cancellation is an acceleration of vesting, and recognize immediately the amount of expenses
that would have been recognized including those benefits that are not earned and are controlled by the Company or the employee and which are not
yet due. In case a new program is implemented to replace one that has been terminated, and it determined as an alternative program on the grant
date to the new program, the terminated program and the new program are processed as if it was an adjustment to the original program, as
mentioned in the previous paragraph.

15. FINANCE LEASE RECEIVABLES
On February 8, 2023, one of the group's companies entered into a revenue sharing agreement with a government entity. The effective date of this
agreement entails the completion of the transitional phase to transfer existing services to the government entity, and that it will be responsible for
implementing and maintaining all services, infrastructure, networks and systems. Accordingly, a transitional plan has been determined that details
the procedures, responsibilities and preconditions.
The transitional phase has begun and in accordance with the agreement, electronic services and operational services will be provided for a period of
five years from the effective date according to the terms and conditions of the agreement. The agreement may be extended for another period.
During the term of the agreement, the company grants the government entity a license to use the platform for electronic services in the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia with conditions that specify the mechanism of use. In addition, the government entity is responsible for implementing and maintaining
all necessary services, infrastructure, networks, systems and communications, and the company is entitled to a contractual financial consideration
as a fixed percentage of the total fees for electronic services.
During the current year, the platform, infrastructure and related assets were transferred to the government entity and this transaction was classified
as a finance lease so that the risks and rewards of ownership were transferred to the government entity.
The Group derecognized the intangible assets and property and equipment related to the platform, where the carrying value was 44.1 million Saudi
Riyals, and a finance lease receivable was recognized based on the present value of future cash flows. This resulted in recording gains within other
income in the amount of 63.1 million Saudi Riyals in the consolidated statement of profit or loss (Note No. 10).
The lease interest was recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and an amount of SR 2.5 million was charged to the consolidated
statement of profit or loss for the current year.

37. RISK MANAMGMENT (CONTINUED)
A. Credit risk (continued)
The Group uses a dedicated matrix for the purpose of calculating expected credit losses for trade receivables, contract assets and employee
receivables. This matrix is based initially on historical default rates. The Group calibrates the matrix to adjust the historical experience of credit losses,
taking into account the information expected in the future. At the date of each financial report, The Group updates the historical default rates and
this is reflected in future estimates, in addition, it calculates additional provisions for specific cases. The Group implemented a dedicated matrix for
the purpose of calculating the present value of money for governmental receivables. Through this matrix, the Group estimates the expected collection
date by applying certain assumptions and inputs such as historical collection experience per client, which is reflected within the low-risk category of
the risk items.
Low value financial assets
A financial asset is considered impaired when one or more events that have a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial
asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is impaired includes observable data about the following events:
•
Significant financial difficulties for the issuer of securities or the lender;
•
A breach of contract, such as a late payment or default;
•
The lender(s) granted the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulty, a privilege(s) that the
lender would not consider;
•
It becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; and
•
The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset due to financial difficulties.
Definition of default
The Group considers the following to be default events, for the purpose of managing credit risk internally because past experience indicates that
receivables that meet any of the following criteria are generally unrecoverable.
• When there is a non-compliance with the financial commitments of the counterparty; or
• Information prepared internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its debt (without regard to any collateral
held by the Group).
write-off policy
The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial distress and there is no realistic
prospect of recovery. For example: when the counterparty is under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Written-off financial
assets may continue to be subject to enforcement activities under The Group's recovery procedures, subject to legal advice where appropriate. Any
recoveries are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
B. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk represents the Group's inability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group minimizes liquidity risk by ensuring that
the necessary liquidity is always available. Except for the obligation to purchase property and lease obligations, all other financial liabilities are
expected to be settled in the following 12 months.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet the expected operating expenses, including servicing its financial obligations, and
this does not include the potential impact of emergency conditions that cannot be reasonably foreseen such as natural disasters. In addition, the
Group maintains various lines of credit.
The Group monitors the risk of shortfall in liquidity using forecast models to determine the effects of operating activities on the overall availability
of liquidity. The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of revolving credit facilities
and other sources of liquidity if needed.

C- Credit risk
Managing the risks of fluctuation in currency exchange rates
Currency risk is the risk that a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group did not carry out significant
transactions in foreign currencies except the US dollar, the British pound and the Euro during the year. The Group was not exposed to the risks of
fluctuation in currency exchange rates during the period, and the management does not expect that the Group will be subject in the future to
transactions related to these risks substantially.
interest rate risk
It is the exposure to various risks associated with the impact of fluctuations in the prevailing interest rates on the financial position and cash flows of
the Group. The Group's interest rate risk arises from bank deposits, short-term bank debt and long-term debt which are at floating interest rates. All
debts and deposits are subject to regular re-pricing. Management monitors changes in interest rates and believes that the fair value and cash flow
interest rate risks are not significant to The Group.

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis
For rate deposits, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of the deposit outstanding at the end of the reporting period was due throughout
the year. An increase or decrease of 50 basis points represents management's assessment of a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
On December 31, 2024, if the group's short-term deposit rates were 50 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, the profit for
the year would be SR 17.3 million higher/lower, as a primary result of higher interest income/ low on variable rate deposits (December 31, 2023: SR
16,9 million).
D - Capital management
The Group's objective when managing capital is to protect the Group's ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and to maintain a strong capital base to support the sustainable development of its business.
38. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Below table shows the book values and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy. It does not
include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value. If the book value reasonably
approximates the fair value, there were no reclassifications of financial assets measured at fair value through the fair value hierarchy levels during
the year:

A. Adjustment of comparative figures for long-term prepaid amounts presentation:
The Group has adjusted the comparative figures for amounts capitalized within intangible assets related to software as a service licenses. The related
agreements were re-evaluated during the year, and the Group concluded that these licenses do not meet the capitalization requirements and represent
prepaid amounts. Accordingly, the comparative figures were adjusted, and prepaid expenses were recognized and amortized over the term of the
agreement.
The changes resulted in adjusting the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of profit or loss as shown in the table
above. The Group did not present a third year in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 1 January 2023 to reflect the effect of the
adjustment, as management believes that the effect is immaterial and does not affect the decisions of users of these consolidated financial statements.
There was no impact on the consolidated statement of equity as at 31 December 2023 and 1 January 2023 and the consolidated statement of cash
flows for the year ended 31 December 2023.
B. Reclassification of comparative figures:
Certain expense items have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in terms of their classification by function. During the
current year, Research and development expenses have been presented separately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, and accordingly,
the expenses for the comparative year have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. In addition, depreciation and amortization have
been presented as they have been allocated to research and development in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
